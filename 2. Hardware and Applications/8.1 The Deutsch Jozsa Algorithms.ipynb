        "\n",
        "Deutsch's algorithm is the first algorithm to demonstrate a clear advantage in quantum computing compared to classical computing.\n",
        "\n",
        "Deutsch's problem is that we have a black box, which computes a one-bit Boolean function. In other words, it is a function that takes one bit and produces one bit as output. For example, this function could represent a routing algorithm, and the output indicates the chosen route (0 or 1).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Let's explain this statement more simply.**\n",
        "\n",
        "* Let's say we are interested in a routing algorithm. This algorithm takes a network map consisting of many different routes and selects the best route to reach a specific destination. For example, when a person wants to go from point A to point B, the routing algorithm can show them the shortest or fastest way.\n",
        "\n",
        "* Now, let's consider this routing algorithm as a \"black box\". This means that this box takes a starting position as input and specifies the best route as output. This function can be thought of as a one-bit Boolean function because it has only two possible outputs: 0 or 1.\n",
        "\n",
        "* For example, if a person wants to go from point A to point B, the routing algorithm can give an output of 0 (0: Shortest route). Alternatively, in another direction, it can give an output of 1 indicating that the route is longer or slower (1: Faster route).\n",
        "\n",
        "Deutsch's problem is to understand the function of this black box. That is, to determine whether this function is constant or balanced. A constant function always gives the same output, while a balanced function produces different outputs depending on the inputs. While this typically requires at least two queries for classical computers, the Deutsch algorithm can determine this function with just one query. This demonstrates the potential acceleration of quantum computers."

Solving an n-bit Boolean function, which requires at least n queries with classical tools, is solved in just one query with the Deutsch-Jozsa algorithm."

However, some classical functions do not provide this property. For example, constant functions f0 and f1 do not map the result of any input to a specific output and therefore cannot be reversed. To execute such functions on quantum computers, we need to make these operations reversible.\n",

Quantum bits can exist as both 0 and 1 simultaneously. This necessitates the use of a measurement basis that is different from the standard computational basis used when performing computations—known as the Z-basis. This is where the Hadamard basis comes into play. The Hadamard basis represents a state of superposition between 0 and 1. Therefore, measuring in this basis allows us to leverage the quantum advantage because classical computers cannot measure in this basis. This simple change brings out the power of quantum computers and enables certain algorithms to run much faster than classical computers."
