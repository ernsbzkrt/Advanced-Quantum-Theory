        "Quantum random number generation differs significantly from random number generation done with classical computers. While classical computers mimic randomness using deterministic algorithms, quantum computers can truly generate random numbers because they operate based on the principles of quantum mechanics.\n",
        "\n",
        "This process typically begins by applying a Hadamard gate on a qubit. The Hadamard gate puts a qubit's state into a superposition. For example, applying a Hadamard gate on a qubit in the |0⟩ state yields the following superposition state:\n",

        "**H|0⟩ = 1/√2 (|0⟩ + |1⟩)**\n",
        "\n",
        "Here, |0⟩ and |1⟩ represent the qubit's basic states. In this case, the probability of the qubit being in both the |0⟩ and |1⟩ states is equal.\n",
        "\n",
        "Subsequently, this superposition state is measured. Upon measurement, it is determined whether the qubit is in the |0⟩ or |1⟩ state. This is sufficient to obtain a single random bit. However, by repeating this process multiple times, more random bits can be obtained.\n",
        "\n",
        "Quantum random number generation provides truly random and unpredictable results due to its reliance on the principles of quantum mechanics. This characteristic is of great importance in cryptography, random number-based algorithms, and many other applications. Therefore, it is believed that quantum computers provide a significant advantage in security and computation fields.\n"

        "**Security:** Truly random numbers are essential for cryptography and security protocols. Pseudo-random numbers generated by classical computers can be predictable by certain algorithms, revealing vulnerabilities in encryption systems. Quantum random numbers, on the other hand, are generated based on quantum mechanics and are therefore absolutely random, making them more reliable.\n",

        "**Machine Learning and Data Analytics:** In fields such as machine learning and data analytics, random numbers are commonly used for tasks like data set partitioning or sampling. Truly random numbers yield more reliable results in such applications.\n",

        "**Games of Chance and Simulations:** In industries like gaming, simulations, and games of chance, truly random numbers are critical for entertainment or the accuracy of outcomes.\n",

Similar to classical random walks' coin toss, in the quantum case, the coin is in a quantum superposition state. The state of a qubit determines the direction in which the particle will move, and at each step, the state of the qubit is updated by a quantum gate.\n",
