Before measurement, the system exists in a state of uncertainty; that is, the system is considered as a mixture of multiple possible states. For example, when measuring the spin of an electron, it can be said that before measurement, the electron has a probability of being in either an \"up\" or \"down\" spin state. However, upon measurement, a definite state of the electron's spin, either \"up\" or \"down,\" is obtained.\n",
