        "\n",
        "Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm (QAOA), developed to solve certain optimization problems using quantum computers, is an algorithm designed to tackle optimization problems that are hard to solve with classical computers, particularly known as NP-hard problems. It was first proposed by Edward Farhi, Jeffrey Goldstone, and Sam Gutmann in 2014.\n",
        "\n",
        "#### **9.2.1. Basics of QAOA**\n",
        "\n",
        "QAOA is an algorithm used by quantum computers to solve optimization problems. Its name stands for \"Quantum Approximate Optimization Algorithm.\" This algorithm aims to find the best solution to a problem that needs to be optimized by leveraging the parallel computing power of quantum computers. This often involves finding a minimum or maximum-cost solution.\n",
        "\n",
        "Let's examine the fundamental elements of QAOA in more detail:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Cost Hamiltonian (C):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   *This Hamiltonian represents the cost function of the problem to be optimized. The cost function determines the \"cost\" of each solution. For example, for the shortest path problem on a graph, the cost function can represent the total length of each path. The Cost Hamiltonian represents this cost function by assigning energy to the states of quantum bits.*\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **Mixing Hamiltonian (B):**\n",
        "\n",
        "   *This Hamiltonian is used to mix the states of quantum bits and facilitate transitions between them. Typically, using basic quantum gates like Pauli-X gates, superposition states of all quantum bits are created. This represents the classical part of the algorithm.*\n",
        "\n",
        "**The general workflow of QAOA is as follows:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. Initially, quantum bits are prepared in an initial state. This initial state can often be a superposition state of all quantum bits.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. In the first step, the Mixing Hamiltonian (B) is applied to mix the states of quantum bits. This step allows quantum bits to interact with each other.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Then, the Cost Hamiltonian (C) is applied. This assigns energy to the states of quantum bits and computes the cost function.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. These two steps are repeated in a loop. Each loop step represents a QAOA step.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. After several QAOA steps, the state of quantum bits converges to a state close to the optimal solution of the problem to be optimized.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, QAOA attempts to find the solution to an optimization problem using the Cost and Mixing Hamiltonians. This algorithm aims to solve some optimization problems more effectively by leveraging the parallel computing capabilities of quantum computers."

The Hadamard gate equally increases the probability of a qubit being in the states 0 and 1 simultaneously, allowing all qubits to be in a superposition state. This step establishes the starting point of the algorithm.\n",

        "\n",
        "QAOA employs a certain number of iteration steps (p steps). In each step, a transition is made between the cost Hamiltonian and the mixing Hamiltonian. During these transitions, parameters denoted as β and γ are adjusted, representing the durations of the application of each Hamiltonian. These parameters are chosen depending on the nature and complexity of the optimization problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. Step Iteration:**\n",
        "\n",
        "In each iteration step, the cost Hamiltonian (e^(-iγC)) is applied first, followed by the mixing Hamiltonian (e^(-iβB)). These operations manipulate the states of the quantum bits, creating an optimization journey to search for the solution of the problem. These steps are repeated several times depending on the depth of the algorithm (i.e., the number of p steps). Each iteration step contributes to improving the solution.\n",

This solution provides feedback to optimize the parameters β and γ, determined using a classical optimization algorithm. This step can be iteratively repeated to enhance the quality of the solution.\n",
