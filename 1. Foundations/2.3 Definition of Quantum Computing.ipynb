        "\n",
        "While there are various definitions for quantum computers available today, considering the general characteristics of quantum computers, we can make the following definitions:\n",
        "\n",
        "**1. A Scalable Physical System:**\n",
        "\n",
        "A system formed by assembling basic units called qubits. These qubits should be distinct from each other, and we should be able to precisely count the number of qubits in the system.\n",
        "\n",
        "**2. The Ability to Initialize the State of Any Qubit:**\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, being able to set all qubits to a certain initial state.\n",
        "\n",
        "**3. The Ability to Preserve the States of Qubits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "The system must be isolated from the external world to preserve the states of qubits. While some decay of the states may be allowed, it should be minimal, and the states of qubits should not change between operations.\n",
        "\n",
        "**4. The Ability to Apply a Series of Unit Operators to Qubit States:**\n",
        "\n",
        "This means mathematical operations can be applied to change the states of qubits. Additionally, it's important to establish connections between two qubits.\n",
        "\n",
        "**5. The Ability to Make Strong Measurements of Qubits:**\n",
        "\n",
        "Measurement techniques should be able to measure the state of qubits and project them into the measured state. This ensures that qubits remain in the desired state.\n",
