# 🌌 Quantum Theory Repository 🚀

This repository aims to comprehensively discuss quantum theory and its intricacies. Topics previously discussed at a fundamental level and more will be explored within the scope of this repository, including discussions on mathematical foundations.

## Purpose 🎯
I believe that quantum computation needs to be approached scientifically, distinct from traditional computer methodologies. Therefore, we previously prepared a repository discussing Quantum Theory at a basic level. Now, we will delve into more advanced theories to better understand Quantum Algorithms and the intricacies of Quantum Computation.

## Content 📚
The content of this repository will be updated over time. Consider it as the first step in a long journey. Generally, I envision the topics to be as follows. Each main topic will have its own subtopics, which we will discuss over time.

**1. Foundations** 
- 🌀 Superposition, Entanglement, and Reversibility
- 🔍 A Brief History of Quantum Computing
- ⚛️ Qubits, Operators, and Measurement
- 🧩 Complexity Theory

**2. Hardware and Applications**
- 🛠️ Building a Quantum Computer
- 💻 Development Libraries for Quantum Computer Programming
- 🌐 Teleportation, Superdense Coding, and Bell's Inequality
- 🚀 Quantum Computing Methods
- 📡 Applications and Quantum Supremacy

**3. Toolkit**
- 🔢 Mathematical Tools for Quantum Computing
- 📝 Dirac Notation
