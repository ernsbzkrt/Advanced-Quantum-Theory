        "Cloud Computing, which we frequently hear about nowadays, also manifests itself here. **Cloud Quantum Computing** provides an infrastructure where algorithms can be run on real quantum hardware for developers. This seemingly incredible reality is actually achieved with the help of a small simulator. Before running an algorithm on a quantum computer, a quantum simulator is used to test the code. These simulators run on classical computers and cannot process real quantum states, but they are extremely useful for testing the syntax and flow of the code. These simulators can run locally or in the cloud. It is acknowledged that when these simulators run on a classical computer, they cannot process real quantum states; however, they are very useful for testing the syntax and flow of the code.\n",

In this case, a small increase in the number of qubits can lead to a significant increase in memory requirements. This phenomenon makes it difficult to simulate quantum systems on classical computers because it is not feasible to cope with the rapidly increasing memory requirements of the systems.*\n",
