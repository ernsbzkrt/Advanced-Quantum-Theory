Laboratories typically use mercury (Hg) or rubidium (Rb) atoms for this purpose. Using this laser system, we can cool the atoms to very low temperatures. Then, we can transfer a small group of atoms to an addressable array. The Lukin Laboratory at Harvard has made progress in neutral atom systems and reported many advancements in controlling larger arrays of atoms. Similarly, David Weiss and his team at Penn State University have focused on neutral atom platforms and demonstrated a neutral atom experiment. The Pascal group in France and their academic partners at IOGS are developing a neutral atom quantum computer with more than 100 qubits.\n",
