        "Simon’s Problem is an algorithm and a sample problem set used in the field of quantum computing to solve a classical problem. It was originally proposed by Daniel Simon and is one of the early examples demonstrating that quantum computers can be faster than classical computers for certain specific problems.\n",

        "Simon’s Problem involves the following:\n",
        "\n",
        "* Consider a function 𝑓:{0,1}𝑛→{0,1}𝑛, where 𝑓:{0,1} n →{0,1} n.\n",
        "\n",

        "\n",
        "To solve this problem on a classical computer, we need to check the output of the function for all possible x values and their corresponding 𝑥 ⊕ 𝑠 values. This requires, on average, 2^𝑛/2 function calls. Let's explain and discuss this a bit further.\n",

        "* 2^10/2 =\n",
        "* 2^5 = 32, indicating that 32 function calls are required. It can be observed that as the **n value** increases, this number grows exponentially. Therefore, solving this problem on classical computers becomes a time-consuming and challenging process.\n",
        "\n",
        "The classical solution of the problem involves checking the condition 𝑓(𝑥) = 𝑓(𝑥⊕ 𝑠) for x and 𝑥 ⊕ 𝑠 pairs. This process involves many trials and errors based on probability. For each new x, we need to check whether f(x) equals 𝑓(𝑥⊕ 𝑠), and this process continues until any information about 𝑠 is obtained.\n",
