        "Complexity Theory, briefly, is a field in computer science and mathematics that studies the complexity of problems such as computability and solvability. This theory focuses on determining how much time and resources an algorithm or problem-solving process will require. It often involves analyzing the performance of an algorithm based on the size of the problem or input."

For example, quicksort, mergesort, insertion sort, etc. An algorithm is a hardware-independent method of solving a computational problem. Nowadays, developers typically strive to find or develop algorithms that can efficiently solve a problem. A program, on the other hand, is a specific implementation of an algorithm in a particular programming language. It's the applied version of the algorithm. Despite their seeming similarity, they are not the same.\n",
