        "\n",
        "Quantum supremacy refers to the ability of quantum computers to perform a specific computational task that surpasses the capabilities of today's most powerful classical computers. This task may be one that classical computers cannot effectively solve or one that is extremely difficult for them to solve. The term is used for experiments demonstrating that quantum computers can outperform classical computers in solving a particular problem.\n",
        "\n",
        "For example, a task called \"random circuit sampling\" is often used to demonstrate quantum supremacy. In this task, samples are taken from the output distribution of a quantum circuit. Quantum computers can naturally perform such a process because they can simulate the evolution of circuits according to the laws of quantum mechanics. However, for classical computers, this process is typically extremely complex and becomes exponentially more difficult as the number of qubits increases. Therefore, the effective execution of this task by a quantum computer implies surpassing the capabilities of classical computers.\n",
        "\n",
        "The demonstration of quantum supremacy is not only a milestone but also a crucial part of validating large-scale quantum computation in accordance with quantum mechanics. Such experiments serve as a powerful tool to test the functionality of quantum computers and their compatibility with quantum theory. Moreover, quantum supremacy experiments provide a pivotal point in computer science by questioning fundamental theoretical concepts such as the Extended Church-Turing Thesis, which claims that any algorithm can be effectively simulated by a Turing machine, but quantum supremacy experiments refute this claim.\n",
        "\n",
        "In conclusion, the demonstration of quantum supremacy is of critical importance for understanding the limits and potentials of quantum computers. These experiments provide significant insights into the future of both quantum computing and the large-scale utilization of quantum mechanics. Thus, quantum supremacy represents a crucial field in both theoretical and practical computer science and physics.\n"
